# Remote-control-car-by-raspberry-pi

<h2 dir=auto><b>Forword:</b> It is my iOT project. I know it's not remarkable, yet I tried my best.</h2>

As the title, what I've done is a remote control car. With the camera on it,the car can move and monitor on the flat floor, using the program to make it go wherever you want.
