# Remote-control-car-by-raspberry-pi

<h3 dir=auto><b>Forword:</b> It is my iOT project. I know it's not remarkable, yet I tried my best.</h3>
<hr>
<p>  As the title, what I did is a remote control car. With the camera on it,the car can move and monitor on the flat floor, using the program to make it go wherever you want.</p>
<br><p>To reach the goal, we need to prepare these materials in advance:</p>
<h4>Raspberry pi, Camera module, The car chassis with motor, Motor control board, Battery case, Bracket</h4>

<h3>Step 1. assemble the car chassis and fix the battery case on it</h3><a href="https://ibb.co/X3DR7Kj"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vQhn3TV/DSC-5455.jpg" alt="DSC-5455" border="0"></a><a href="https://ibb.co/m68xnXR"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/KFw1tL5/DSC-5456.jpg" alt="DSC-5456" border="0"></a><a href="https://ibb.co/CHdwyGS"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/LZw0y7s/DSC-5457.jpg" alt="DSC-5457" border="0"></a>
