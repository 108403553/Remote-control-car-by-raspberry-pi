# Remote-control-car-by-raspberry-pi

<h3 dir=auto><b>Forword:</b> It is my iOT project. I know it's not remarkable, yet I tried my best.</h3>
<hr>
As the title, what I've done is a remote control car. With the camera on it,the car can move and monitor on the flat floor, using the program to make it go wherever you want.
To reach the goal, we need to prepare these materials in advance:
<h4>Raspberry pi, Camera module, The car chassis with motor, Motor control board, Battery case, Bracket</h4>

<h3>Step 1 assemble the car chassis and fix the battery case on it</h3>
